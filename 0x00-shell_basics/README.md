# 0x00. Shell, Basics

This project is part of the curriculum of Holberton School. The goal is to learn the basics of the shell including navigation, file handling, and simple scripting.

## Description

This repository contains various scripts that introduce foundational concepts of the shell. Students will learn how to navigate directories, manage files, and perform basic operations.

## Requirements

- All scripts tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Scripts are written in Bash 4.4 or later

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to start working with the scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omartalat/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
cd 0x00-shell_basics
```

## Usage

Each script can be executed to perform various tasks related to shell basics. Here's how you can make a script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod u+x script_name
./script_name
```
